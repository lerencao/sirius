Welcome to the Sirius source code repository! 

## About

Sirius is a blockchain layer 2 protocol implementation, currently supported Ethereum. Project is under heavy development, not production ready.

Inspiration of the name "Sirius" comes from the brightest star in the night sky.

## Overview

Sirius implement a 2nd-layer financial intermediary protocol secure against double-spending that guarantees users control of funds through leveraging a smart contract enabled (currently on Ethereum) decentralized blockchain ledger as a means of dispute resolution.

Two-party payment channels networks have been proposed for trust-free payments that do not exhaust the resources of the blockchain; however, they bear multiple fundamental limita-tions. Sirius is designed for secure N-party payment hubs with improved transaction utility and cheaper operational costs.

A hub is the operator server which can operate a verifier smart contract for handling the interactive between the blockchain and client.

Clients hold their private keys that control their identities and use them to sign off-chain transactions while communicating with hub. They also use the private keys to control their on-chain wallets.

The hub will periodically commits the off-chain ledger state as a proof to the blockchain. once a untrusted or malicious operation happen, the client can issue a challenge to hub and withdraw their funds.

### Prerequisites

1. Java(1.8)
2. solc (0.5.1) [installing-solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.1/installing-solidity.html)
2. Docker(for run and test)

#### Build

Go to project dir:

```bash
./gradlew build -x test
```

Build by Docker(Java and solc in docker image)

```bash
./gradleDocker build -x test
```

#### Test

Run unit tests

```bash
./gradlew unitTest
```

Run unit tests by Docker

```bash
./gradleDocker unitTest
```

Run integration tests(need Docker environment)

```bash
./gradlew integrationTest
```

#### Development Environment
Using Ethereum on Docker
```
./scripts/docker.sh run --dev.period 10
```

Or connecting to the ethereum ropsten testnet
```
./docs/ethereum_ropsten_setup.md
```
